MovieReco - Personalized Movie Recommendations Through Machine Learning and Data Management


Project: The main problem this project aims to solve is to recommend movies to a user which 
they are likely to enjoy based on their preferences, watch history, and specific movie attributes
such as the cast, genre, and ratings the movie received. Using the patterns we analyze from the user 
behavior, we can build a model which gives a personalized recommendation for each user. This will help users
discover new content and make it much easier for them to decide what to watch. It can also help streaming platforms 
enhance their systems by implementing such a model in order to attract more customers.
